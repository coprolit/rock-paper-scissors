# rock-paper-scissors
A basic implementation of a real-time, browser-based rock-paper-scissors game engine.

Utilising Node.js, Socket.io and a few ES6 features (e.g. Promise, generator).

###### Disclaimer
This is a pet project (I wanted to tinker with real-time and fullstack Javascript). The game is fully functional, but rudimentary.

### App Architecture

* `/browser/...` Contains files for the client runtime.
* `/heroku/...` Contains the Node.js game engine server.
